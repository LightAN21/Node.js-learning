Node: a runtime environment for executing JavaScript code

1.	(non-blocking)asynchronous architecture (like a kitchen)

	A single thread is used to handle multiple requests.

	There's an enent queue in the background.

	Therefore, Node is ideal for I/O-intensive apps(touch the file operating system or network), 
	not for CPU-intensive apps(like video encoding or image manipulation service)
